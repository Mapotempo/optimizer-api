            Because Active hash doesn't call the validators of the sub classes and validation checks similar
            to followings are never performed during runtime. Therefore this test is misleading and skipped
            until we implement a proper validation for time windows.
            5th and 6th asserts currently fail. SEE models/activity.rb for further note."
